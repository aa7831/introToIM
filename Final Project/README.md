# Remote Control Car
<ul>
  <li>Team Members: Abdullah Ahmed and Mishel Rashid </li>
  <li>The car is controlled through the WASD keys on a laptop keyboard through p5js. </li>
  <li>NRF modules used for communication between Arduino Uno connected to laptop and Arduino Mega connected on a car </li>
  <li>Added feature: lights on a car that turn on when standing still in a dark environment so the user can view the surroundings before moving. They turn off when moving or in a bright environment. </li>
  <li>The program on p5js provides the user with instructions as well as real-time response telling the user where the car is currently moving. </li>
</ul>

# Future improvements
<ul>
  <li>3D Print a case for the car so the wires are hidden from the eye. </li>
  <li>Add two-way communication between the car and the transmitter module for improved user interaction on p5js. </li>
  <li>Figure out a way to include the ultrasonic sensor without short-circuiting the board. </li>
</ul>
