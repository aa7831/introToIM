# Initial Idea and Team Members
<ul>
  <li>Team Members: Abdullah and Mishel. </li>
  <li>We plan on making a remote control car.</li>
  <li>This will require the use of p5js, 2 arduinos, and a car that we will build using materials from the IM Lab and the wheels in the sparksfun inventor kit.</li>
  <li>One arduino will be connected to a laptop at all time to send and receive data with p5js.</li>
  <li>This arduino will also send data to the other arduino using some sort of connection (radio waves maybe). It is still unclear how we plan on executing this.</li>
  <li>The second arduino will be attached to the remote control car and its component. It will be powered using batteries or a power bank.</li>
  <li>The second arduino will decode the instructions sent by the user through p5js and the first arduino to make movements on the car.</li>
  <li>The use of two arduinos is necessary as we need 1 to be connected to a laptop to take input from the user and a second one connected to the car's components. </li>
</ul>


# Finalised Idea and Concept
<ul>
  <li>Remote Control Car </li>
  <li>Creative Part: Introduce an object detection system. Sensors around the car that will detect if it is getting to close to any object.</li>
  <li>If the car is getting close, a warning will be displayed on p5js along with a sound or a voice saying "slow down, object detected". </li>
</ul>

### Components Needed
<ol>
  <li>2 Arduinos </li>
  <li>nRF24L01 module to communicate between the 2 arduinos. </li>
  <li>Ultrasonic sensor - to detect objects </li>
  <li>4 Wheels </li>
  <li>4 motors </li>
  <li>Battery for the arduino attached to the car</li>
  <li>Casing for the car - Built ourselves using materials from the IM Lab </li>
</ol>

### Additional Features if time permits
<ul>
  <li>LEDs on the car with light sensor as well. If it gets too dark in the room, the LEDS will light up automatically. </li>
</ul>
