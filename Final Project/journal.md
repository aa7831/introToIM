# Initial Idea and Team Members
<ul>
  <li>Team Members: Abdullah and Mishel. </li>
  <li>We plan on making a remote control car.</li>
  <li>This will require the use of p5js, 2 arduinos, and a car that we will build using materials from the IM Lab and the wheels in the sparksfun inventor kit.</li>
  <li>One arduino will be connected to a laptop at all time to send and receive data with p5js.</li>
  <li>This arduino will also send data to the other arduino using some sort of connected (radio waves maybe). It is still unclear how we plan on executing this.</li>
  <li>The second arduino will be attached to the remote control car and its component. It will be powered using batteries or a power bank.</li>
  <li>The second arduino will decode the instructions sent by the user through p5js and the first arduino to make movements on the car.</li>
