# Idea
<ul>
  <li>The original idea was to use some tools from the Interactive Media Lab to make a cool switch, however the lab closed down before I could make it there :( </li>
  <li>I then had to improvise. </li>
  <li>The new idea: A switch consisting of a door. When the door opens, the circuit breaks and the light is turned off. When the door is closed, the circuit is completed and the light turns on and blinks. </li>
</ul>

# Process
<ul>
  <li>I taped both the adruino and the breadboard on the door frame.</li>
  <li>One wire taped on the fixed door frame where the hinge is, this does not move </li>
  <li>One wire taped on the door, near the hinge. This wire moves. When it is in resting position (closed door), the circuit is completed as the ends of both the wires meet and therefore, the light blinks </li>
  <li>When the door opens, the wire on the door moves and the circuit breaks. The light therefore does not blink. </li>
  
</ul>

# Problems Faced
<ol>
  <li>Adruino on one side of the door and breadboard on the other side meant that the wire would break if the door is opened too much. In order to solve this, instead of placing the boards near the door knob, I placed them near the hinge where movement is minimal. This allowed me to make the circuit without the need of joining multiple wires or the danger of wires breaking when the door opens.</li>
</ol>
